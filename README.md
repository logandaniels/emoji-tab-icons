# :pray: Emoji tab icons for Safari :pray:

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

After switching from Chrome to Safari, one feature was hard for me to live without: tab icons. Chrome adds a website's favicon as an icon for all tabs you have open for that website. Safari doesn't do this, which makes it hard to tell at a glance what site each of your tabs is on.

This extension lets you add emoji icons to your tabs on a site-by-site basis, to simulate Chrome's tab favicons.
