# :pray: Emoji tab icons for Safari :pray:

After switching from Chrome to Safari, one feature was hard for me to live without: tab icons. Chrome adds a website's favicon as an icon for all tabs you have open for that website. Safari doesn't do this, which makes it hard to tell at a glance what site each of your tabs is on.

This extension lets you add emoji icons to your tabs on a site-by-site basis, to simulate Chrome's tab favicons.

## Installation
Download and open [emoji-tab-icons.safariextz](https://github.com/logandaniels/emoji-tab-icons/raw/v1.0/emoji-tab-icons.safariextz).

Unfortunately, installing untrusted extensions is buggy in Safari. When you open the ``.safariextz`` file, Safari will ask you to confirm that you really want to install it. If you're lucky, clicking "Trust" will install the extension. Often, though, nothing will happen and you'll have to try opening the file multiple times or restart Safari before it installs. If you still can't get it to install, [this StackExchange answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/214760/force-installing-untrusted-safari-extensions/233701#233701) provides a (clunky) workaround.
